Let me introduce to you the Hercules GS402B Mini Guitar Stand. As the owner of newly purchased Epiphone Les Paul electric guitar, my most expensive guitar purchase to date, I was looking for a guitar stand which would allow me to put my instrument on display and be a  permanent feature within my living room.

I bought this guitar not just for the way it sounds but also for the way it looks; I wanted it to be a functioning piece of furniture that would be easily accessible and not stored away in a cupboard like I had kept previous guitars. In order to satisfy this requirement I wished to find a free-standing guitar stand that would not detract from the shape or beauty of my instrument but would be sturdy enough to hold my guitar in place safely.

I also wanted to make sure the stand I chose would not scratch or dent my guitar when removing or placing it back in the stand. Having had some good and bad guitar stands over the years I was looking for a different brand and design from what I had used before.

After many weeks of deliberating over a number of different stands my mind was made up after reading some great reviews on the Hercules GS402B Mini Guitar Stand and I purchased it from Amazon.

Upon opening my Amazon package I was not disappointed and was immediately happy with my purchase. The Hercules stand is small but mighty! Upon first handling and observing the stand you can feel the superior build quality. The stand is made of … and can support a guitar up to weight of … The rubber feet provide a sturdy grip on any floor surface - mines sits on hardwood flooring - and the stand does not move or slide when taking out or replacing the guitar back in the stand.

The guitar body rests against a large foam padded block which makes contact with the rear of the guitar and the two hooks which support the bottom of the guitar and keep it secure are also foam padded so the guitar is not touched by any surface other than foam. This has kept my guitar free from any damage.

The below images show my guitar standing tall and proud and only the feet and lower part of this stand is visible; no other part of the stand can be seen which I love. It allows the guitar body to be observed on it's own.

The Hercules stand comes in a handy carry bag and folds/opens easily if taking on the move. I take mines between home and the music studio when I am practising.

I’ve been using this stand for over 10 months now and my guitar has taken pride of place in my living room. I'm so pleased with this stand that I also bought the ... for my accoustic guitar.

The Hercules GS402B Mini Guitar Stand and ... will last me for many years and if I purchase another guitar in future then I'll also be adding another Hercules guitar stand to my order.

This product has earned a place on my Love This Product blog because it oozes quality. It folds and opens easily and keeps my guitars secure whether standing upright at home or at the studio.
